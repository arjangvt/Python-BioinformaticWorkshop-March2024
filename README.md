This workshop explores Python programming language as a tool in the 
bioinformatics and scientific environments and how the language, with several available 
Open-source libraries can serve as a powerful weapon in your biological data 
analysis arsenal!
The material of this workshop is designed as a stand-alone introduction to the 
aspect of Python with a brief emphasis on the basic programming topic and bioinformatics libraries such as 
biopython.
